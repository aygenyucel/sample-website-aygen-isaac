        <p>In computing, a programming language specification (or standard or definition) is a documentation artifact that defines a programming language so that users and implementors can agree on what programs in that language mean.</p>
        <p>Specifications are typically detailed and formal, and primarily used by implementors, with users referring to them in case of ambiguity</p>
        <p>the C++ specification is frequently cited by users, for instance, due to the complexity.</p>

        <p>Not all major programming languages have specifications, and languages can exist and be popular for decades without a specification. A language may have one or more implementations</p>
        <p>A language may be implemented and then specified, or specified and then implemented, or these may develop together, which is usual practice today. This is because implementations and specifications provide checks on each other: writing a specification requires precisely stating the behavior of an implementation</p>
